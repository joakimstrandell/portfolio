# System-first (Contracts / Infra / Tooling) Pattern

## When to use

Use when the value is a technical/system approach that enabled safer, faster, or more consistent delivery across teams or services.

## Recommended structure (portfolio-aligned)

1. Overview
2. The Challenge (with checklist)
3. The Approach (with checklist)
4. Implementation Highlights (2–4 subsections with bold lead-ins)
5. Results (checklist _or_ bold-labeled paragraphs)
6. Learnings (2–3 short lessons)
7. Technical Summary (Stack + Scope)
8. Next (CTA)

## Language cues

- Emphasize: single source of truth, automation, guardrails, adoption.
- Show cross-team impact (services, teams, products).
- Tie every tool/process decision to an outcome (speed, quality, reduced risk).

## Implementation Highlights (suggested subsections)

Pick 2–4, keep them concrete:

- **Contract workflow**: how contracts were authored/reviewed/versioned; how changes were coordinated.
- **Generated clients**: what was generated (types/SDK/hooks/validators) and why it mattered.
- **Integration patterns**: how teams consumed the system; conventions; onboarding path.
- **Governance**: ADRs, best-practice docs, review gates, CI checks, linting/validation.

## Results formats

Pick one and keep consistent per page:

- **Checklist (3–5 bullets)**: short outcome statements suitable for scanning.
- **Bold-labeled paragraphs**: Adoption / Velocity / Quality / Onboarding / Reusability.

## CTA (“Next”)

End with a direct invitation consistent with the rest of the portfolio:

- “If you want to build reliable, scalable contracts and type-safe integrations, let’s talk.”
- Link text typically: “Start a conversation”.
