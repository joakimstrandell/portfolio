# Narrative (Unification / Role Arc / Org Change) Pattern

## When to use

Use when the value is best shown as a journey over time: role evolution, unifying multiple products, or change management that shifts how teams work.

## Recommended structure (portfolio-aligned)

1. Overview
2. The Challenge (with checklist)
3. The Unification / Arc (short)
4. Timeline (optional, 2–4 milestones)
5. The Work
6. Systems Built
7. Why This Worked
8. Results (bold-labeled paragraphs fit well)
9. Learnings
10. Technical Summary
11. Next (CTA)

## Timeline guidance

- Keep to 2–4 milestones.
- Each milestone should show a change in scope/responsibility or a system inflection point.
- Tie milestones to outcomes (not just job titles).

## Language cues

- Emphasize end-to-end ownership and reduced translation/handoffs (when true).
- Show how standards/systems reduced friction over time.
- Keep narrative grounded in concrete work and observable outcomes.

## Results format (recommended)

Short paragraphs with bold labels:

- **Adoption:** …
- **Velocity:** …
- **Quality:** …
- **Onboarding:** …
- **Reusability:** …

## CTA (“Next”)

Match placement and tone used in other case studies; keep it short and direct.
